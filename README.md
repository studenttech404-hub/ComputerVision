## üìÇ Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction
- Predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.
- Techniques: Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

### 2. Landing Zone Detection
- Detects suitable landing zones using computer vision techniques.
- Applications: Drone/robotics navigation.

### 3. MNIST Object Detection
- Handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
- Techniques: CNNs for object classification.

### 4. Movie Genre Classification
- Classifies movies into genres based on features.
- Techniques: Natural Language Processing (NLP) + classification algorithms.

### 5. PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Detection
- Detects whether a person is wearing safety equipment (e.g., helmet, vest).
- Applications: Workplace safety monitoring.

### 6. Bolts Detection
- Detects bolts in industrial images.
- Applications: Manufacturing quality inspection.

### 7. Spam SMS Detection
- Classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam.
- Techniques: NLP + classification models.
